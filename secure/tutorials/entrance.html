    <h1>Before Reading:</h1>
    <p>
      Please Recognize that you use the website at your own discretion. I really
      don't care if you get in trouble, make sure that the teacher doesn't see
      you, etc etc
    </p>
    <h1>Getting in</h1>
    <p>
      You probably know how to get in based on how you are here right now.
      However, Just to go over:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Log into the website from the blue background place.</li>
      <li>You are now in the decoy site. Go into the settings page.</li>
      <li>
        The Session ID will be listed under the avatar. For each character, type
        it in order in the 5 boxes below.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>The Session ID will RESET every time you get it wrong.</li>
        <li>The Session ID is case sensitive.</li>
        <li>
          If you get it wrong more than 3 times, you will be locked out of your
          account and WILL NOT be able to log back in.
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>You can DM me to get back your access.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <li>Click the Submit button to Log In.</li>
      <li>There you go! You are now logged in.</li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Features</h1>
    <h3>As of 3/16/22</h3>
    <p>You can</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Watch Youtube</li>
      <li>Add playlists</li>
      <li>Play some games</li>
      <li>Chat (Coming Soon)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Youtube</h1>
    <p>
      Insert any youtube link that actually works. I.E.<a
        >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      There MUST be a <strong>https://</strong> in the link. The program will
      NOT WORK if it is not there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some videos do not work simply because the school blocks 1 specific URL.
      (Not GoGuardian, but the wifi)
    </p>
    <p>
      There is always an alternative, for example, there is always a copy of a
      song on youtube. Use that.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you can't find a video, look it up on google itself. The school blocks
      some youtube videos from even showing up on youtube, but not on google.
    </p>
    <p>
      The playlist feature, when it is out, will make you be able to play and
      create a playlist.
    </p>
    <p>However:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>ANY inappropriate videos WILL be taken down.</li>
      <li>
        If you don't use one for a while, it will automatically be deleted,
        unless there is a reason that is told beforehand.
      </li>
      <li>With some offenses, permission to make playlists may be revoked.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Playlists</h2>
    <p>Click on the "Add Playlist" button on the video page.</p>
    <p>
      Input all the required credentials. YOUTUBE LINKS MUST BE SEPERATED BY
      COMMA.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Note!</strong>Any links that do not fit youtube links will
      automatically be removed. Links that work will be added, but any other
      links will not be added.
    </p>
    <p>You can always view your playlists by clicking on "View Playlists".</p>
    <p>In order to play a playlist, follow these instructions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Into the input box, type "playlist yourplaylistname" (I.E. A playlist
        named "bob" would be "playlist bob"
      </li>
      <li>
        The playlist will automatically start playing. You don't have to click
        play.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>As always, any regular youtube links will work.</p>
    <h1>Games</h1>
    <p>
      This one is pretty simple. None of the FNAF games work. If you want to
      request a game, tell me, and I will GLADLY put it in (assuming you raen't
      asking for minecraft or something)
    </p>
    <h1>Chat</h1>
    <h3>Adding a room</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Click on "Add new room"</li>
      <li>Input the display name of a friend, (ask them for it, they know what it means)</li>
      <li>Input your password (it can be wrong)</li>
      <li>If your password is right and the person exists, the menu will update with your new room.</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
      <li>Any rooms with unread messages will be in the top. There is no indicator, will add that soon. They will be from latest unread to oldest unread.</li>
      <li>Any rooms that have read messages will follow after, from latest read to oldest read.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Messaging</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Select a room, then put your message in.</li>
      <li>Click send</li>
    </ol>
    <p>- The button will not work until you actually select a room.</p>

    <h1>Exit</h1>
    <p>
      There isn't a log out button. You just close the window. At any time, if
      you close the tab, reload it, etc it will automatically log you out.
    </p>
    <h4>That's it! Thank you for watching!</h4>
